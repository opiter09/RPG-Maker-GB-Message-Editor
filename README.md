# RPG-Maker-GB-Message-Editor
This small code allows you to edit existing messages in the fan-translation of the game RPG Tsukuru GB. Although it is a smaller ROM, and thus contains less
assets, than its sequel, this game's fan translation is far more complete, and so that is why I have chosen to target it.

As far as operating the code, there are more than a few quirks:
- Instead of making you choose a save file, the program automatically selects the first .sav file in its folder of exactly 32,768 bytes. So try not to have more than
  one in the program's folder
- You can only edit messages that exist already in the save. I do not know how message space is allocated, and I could not even find the pointers to them, so just
  deal with it (and make sure to make each message's original text distinguishable from each other)
- Although messages are only shown in uppercase, you can type in any case you want; it will be converted automatically
- The quotes are "Japanese-style" with the right-angle things, so you must enter them in the editor using square brackets ("\[" and "\]")
- The other special characters are entered as follows:
  - ; = mid-period
  - â€¦ (fancy ellipsis character) = four dots
  - @ = heart
  - $ = eighth-note
  - & = sixteenth-notes
  - \# = droplet (tear?)
  - ` = comma-thing next to the open period
  - \* = open period
- Each message can only have four lines, each up to 16 characters in length. I don't know how to enforce this in the editor, so it just automatically truncates
  when saving to the save file
- The "Save" button saves the text into memory, so that if you switch to another one and come back, it will be the same. The "Write All" button, on the other hand,
  actually writes it (and the other messages) into the save file
- The "Run Game" button opens the game with the same name as the opened save file in the default app (i.e. what happens when you double-click it) using
  os.startfile(). I am given to understand that this function only works on Windows, so you may have to forgo this small convenience
  
# Note
This more applies to editing things in-game, but for all dialogue you should use the *third* font, the one with only uppercase letters. Otherwise, it will render as
Japanese in-game for some reason. Furthermore, the blank characer in between the dash and the Japanese-quotes in this font actually represents a tilde ("~"). For
spell names, monster names, etc. you can use the first font just fine, especially since it matches the battle messages.
